#Title: Improve test coverage for API

---

## 📊 Current State

- **Overall test coverage: 45.49%** (308/677 statements)
- **Routes coverage: 11.3%** (38/336 statements)
- **Models coverage: 0%** (0/336 statements)
- Only **1 test file exists**: `branch.test.ts`

## 🎯 Objective

Increase API test coverage to **85%+** by implementing comprehensive unit tests for all routes and models.

## 📋 Missing Test Files

### 🔗 Route Tests (High Priority)

The following route files need complete test coverage:

- [ ] `src/routes/delivery.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/headquarters.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/order.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/orderDetail.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/orderDetailDelivery.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/product.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/supplier.test.ts`

### 🏗️ Model Tests (Medium Priority)

The following model files need validation tests:

- [ ] `src/models/delivery.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/headquarters.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/order.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/orderDetail.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/orderDetailDelivery.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/product.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/supplier.test.ts`
- [ ] `src/models/branch.test.ts`

## ✅ Test Coverage Requirements

### For Each Route Test File:

- **CRUD Operations:**
    - ✅ GET all entities
    - ✅ GET single entity by ID
    - ✅ POST create new entity
    - ✅ PUT update existing entity
    - ✅ DELETE entity by ID

- **Error Scenarios:**
    - ❌ 404 for non-existent entities
    - ❌ 400 for invalid request payloads
    - ❌ 422 for validation errors
    - ❌ Edge cases (malformed IDs, empty requests)

### For Each Model Test File:

- Data structure validation
- Property types and constraints
- Default values
- Business logic validation
- Serialization/deserialization

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### Use Existing Pattern

Follow the pattern established in `src/routes/branch.test.ts`:

```typescript
import {describe, it, expect, beforeEach} from 'vitest';
import request from 'supertest';
import express from 'express';
```

### Test Structure Template

```typescript
describe('[Entity] API', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        // Setup app and reset data
    });

    it('should create a new [entity]', async () => { /* POST test */
    });
    it('should get all [entities]', async () => { /* GET all test */
    });
    it('should get a [entity] by ID', async () => { /* GET by ID test */
    });
    it('should update a [entity] by ID', async () => { /* PUT test */
    });
    it('should delete a [entity] by ID', async () => { /* DELETE test */
    });
    it('should return 404 for non-existing [entity]', async () => { /* Error test */
    });
});
```

## 🎯 Coverage Targets

### Phase 1: Routes (Immediate)

- **Target: 80%+ route coverage**
- Focus on happy path CRUD operations
- Use `branch.test.ts` as template

### Phase 2: Error Handling (Short-term)

- **Target: 90%+ route coverage**
- Add comprehensive error scenarios
- Add edge case validation

### Phase 3: Models & Integration (Medium-term)

- **Target: 70%+ overall coverage**
- Add model validation tests
- Add cross-entity relationship tests

### Phase 4: Comprehensive (Long-term)

- **Target: 85%+ overall coverage**
- Add application-level tests
- Add performance testing

## 🔧 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:api

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:api -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm run test:api -- src/routes/product.test.ts
```

## 📈 Success Criteria

- [ ] All 8 missing route test files created
- [ ] All 8 model test files created
- [ ] Overall test coverage ≥ 85%
- [ ] Route coverage ≥ 90%
- [ ] Model coverage ≥ 70%
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with `product.test.ts` - copy `branch.test.ts` pattern
2. Implement basic CRUD tests first
3. Add error scenarios incrementally
4. Run coverage after each file to track progress
5. Follow ERD relationships for cross-entity testing
